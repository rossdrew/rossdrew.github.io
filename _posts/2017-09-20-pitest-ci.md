## Pitest

[Pitest](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest) is a _mutation testing_ product written by [Henry Coles](https://github.com/hcoles).  It essentially mutates your code to see how many mutations are caught by your unit tests.  It's a great tool for analysing the robustness of unit tests.

## The Problem

I have an open source product that I'm working on, an emulator called [EmuRox](https://github.com/rossdrew/emuRox).  I created it as a larger product I could test technologies and approaches out on.  I've been running Pitest on it for a while to improve my pretty comprehensive tests. 
The problem is that no one that I've found has created a Pitest CI integration, let alone one that provides a GitHub shield and I want one.

### What was required?

I needed a very small application server and something I could write small web scripts pretty quickly in.  After some R&D I decided to go with Python and a free app server called [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
I needed my [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) hooked build to include a Pitest report then send it to my new Pitest CI, which means my CI needs endpoints

  - To receive Pitest reports
  - To view Pitest reports
  - To convert Pitest results into GitHub shields

 Lastly, I needed the actual [GitHub](https://github.com/) shield attached to my project.

 ### The CI

 This is a pretty menial task in Python.  Create some endpoints with the web library, contact [shield.io](https://shields.io/) for a shield image and return it.
 As I developed this fast, it initially has a few limitations:-

   - There's no security
   - I only store the last build
   - I can only display the last build
   - I'm returning the Pitest report raw

  Since I'm initially using the free tier of Python Anywhere, that also imposes certain restraints:-

   - I have limited bandwith
   - I have limited processing

   But all in all, it works.  I can:-

   - Take a Pitest XML output and store it
   - Extract data from Pitest XML
   - Convert data to a single coverage percentage
   - Return summerised data
   - Compile this summerised data into a GitHub shield by a call to shield.io

 ### The Hook

 I use Travis CI to do my build, this uses a yml file to do pre and post build actions.  I can just add a `pitest` command to my `after_success` block in there and a `curl` post to my Pitest CI endpoint containing the pitest XML in order to load the most recent run.

```
 - ./gradlew check jacocoTestReport pitest
  ...
 - bash <(curl -X POST -d @build/reports/pitest/mutations.xml http://myPitestCI/report)
 ```

 ### The Display

 Then it's just a case of calling the `/shield` endpoint in the README.md of my project to get a nice, proxied GitHub shield containing summerized Pitest data, as you can see below.
