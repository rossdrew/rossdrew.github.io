## Jeckyll

I've now played around with a few blogging sites and now it's time for Jeckyll.  I want something I can test locally and migrate to new styles with minimum effort, this seems to fit the bill.

</figure>

I am a Software Developer, primarily in Java.

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * My theme will need to have decent code highlighting for code samples
 */
public class HelloWorldCaller {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   }
}
{% endhighlight %}
